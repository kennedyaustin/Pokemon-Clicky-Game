# Overview

For this project, a memory game was created with React. The app was built by breaking up the UI into components, managing those components states, as well as responding to user events.

# Tech Used
● React - built the app
● NodeJS - running the server

# Usage
When the user first gets onto the page, they will be able to read the instructions in the header as well as the name of the application. The user can also see the number of correct choices they have made out of the 12 available as they play the game.

When the user scrolls down they will see the 12 images they will be using to play this memory game. Each time the user clicks on one of the Pokemon, the images will shuffle and the player will click another picture.
